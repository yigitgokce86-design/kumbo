## Child's Voice (Parent as Proxy)

**Q: What does Su care about with money?**

> "She wants independence. She hates asking us for things. She'd rather earn her own money and make her own decisions. The goal isn't just the thing—it's the autonomy."

**Q: What would appeal to someone her age?**

> "Don't be childish. She's 12, she thinks she's 18. If it looks like Spotify or Instagram, she'll use it. If it looks like a kids' game, she'll refuse."

**Q: Would she be motivated by goals?**

> "Definitely. But she sets her own goals. She wouldn't respond to 'Here's a goal I set for you.' It has to be HER choice, or she tunes out."
