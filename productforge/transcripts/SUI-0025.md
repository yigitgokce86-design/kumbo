## Part 2: Problem Exploration

**Q: How do you approach money with Ferhat?**

> "Cash. We're a cash household. I give him physical coins, he keeps them in a box. He can see, touch, count the money. I think that's important—the physical experience."

**Q: What's worked about this approach?**

> "He understands money is real. He counts it, feels the weight. When he spends, he feels it leave his hand. There's something lost in digital—it's too abstract."

**Q: What hasn't worked?**

> "Tracking. I don't know how much he has. He doesn't always remember. Sometimes money goes missing and we don't know if he spent it or lost it. The physical approach lacks accountability."

## Part 4: Solution Reaction

**Q: Would you consider a digital tracking tool?**

> "Maybe... if it didn't REPLACE cash but COMPLEMENTED it. If I could enter what I give him, he could enter what he spends, and we'd both know the balance. Like a shared ledger."

**Q: What would you NOT want?**

> "No cards, no digital payments. He needs to learn with real money first. But tracking digitally? That could work."

**Q: What would convince you to try?**

> "If it was simple. I'm not tech-savvy. If my neighbor could explain it in 5 minutes, I'd try. Also if it was in Turkish, obviously. And if it was free or very cheap."
