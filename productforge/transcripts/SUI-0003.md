## Part 2: Problem Exploration

**Q: How do you teach Mira about money?**

> "She's only 6, so we keep it simple. She knows coins exist. She knows we use the phone to pay sometimes. But she doesn't really get the concept of 'money runs out' or 'we need to save.' When we say 'That's too expensive,' she doesn't understand what that means."

**Q: Have you tried any methods?**

> "We bought her a transparent piggy bank so she can see coins pile up. That helped a little—she likes watching it fill. But she doesn't connect it to buying things. To her, it's just a collection, like her seashells."

**Q: What's the biggest barrier at her age?**

> "Abstraction. She can count to 100, but '100 TL' means nothing to her. She can't translate numbers to value. 'This toy costs 50 TL' and 'This toy costs 500 TL' sound the same to her."

## Part 4: Solution Reaction

**Q: Would you use an app to help teach her?**

> "Maybe, but I'd need it to be really simple. No reading—she's just starting to read. Lots of pictures. Maybe icons for rewards. And honestly, for her age, even the idea of 'earning' is new. I'd want to ease into it."

**Q: What would onboarding need to look like?**

> "Five taps maximum. Set up a goal, maybe take a photo of the toy she wants. Add a few simple tasks—'Clean up toys,' 'Brush teeth.' Done. If it takes more than a minute, I'll abandon it."

**Q: Concerns?**

> "That it's age-appropriate. Some apps are designed for older kids and then say 'ages 6+' but they're really not. The text is small, the concepts are complex. I need something truly designed for early learners."
