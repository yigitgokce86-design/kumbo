## Part 2: Problem Exploration

**Q: You seem like someone who tries new tools. What have you tried for money education?**

> "Everything. Piggy banks, spreadsheets, Greenlight (even though we're in Turkey, I used it when traveling), sticker charts. I even built a Notion database to track Lina's allowance. Nothing stuck perfectly."

**Q: What's missing from existing solutions?**

> "Local. Turkish language, TL currency, culturally relevant examples. And integration—I want it to work with how WE live, not how American families live. Our chore culture is different."

## Part 4: Solution Reaction

**Q: What would make you an early adopter of a new solution?**

> "If it's built by people who understand Turkish families. If it's designed thoughtfully, not just copied from US apps. I want to feel like someone considered MY situation."

**Q: Would you participate in beta testing?**

> "Absolutely. I'd give feedback, report bugs, suggest features. I want to be part of building something great for Turkish kids."

**Q: Most wanted feature?**

> "The goal-task-reward loop working seamlessly. And good design—I can't use ugly apps. If it looks like it was made in 2010, I'm out."
