## Part 2: Problem Exploration

**Q: At 14, does Kaan understand money well?**

> "Better than average, I think. He has a bank account—a junior one linked to mine. He gets monthly allowance directly deposited. But he's impulsive online. Spotify subscriptions, game purchases. The money's gone by mid-month."

**Q: What concerns you?**

> "He's about to graduate to real financial independence. In a few years, he'll have real income, real expenses. I worry he'll make the same mistakes he makes now, just bigger."

## Part 3: Behavior Deep-Dive

**Q: Has he ever saved successfully?**

> "Once, for a music festival ticket. 500 TL. He was laser-focused for two months. But that was externally motivated—his friends were going. Without that pressure, he'd have spent it on other things."

**Q: What drove that success?**

> "Fear of missing out. And a hard deadline—the ticket would sell out. Maybe artificial deadlines could help simulate that?"

## Part 4: Solution Reaction

**Q: Would an app be relevant for a 14-year-old?**

> "Maybe, but it'd have to feel mature. Not childish. He's too cool for 'kiddie' apps. Maybe something that looks like Revolut but for teens? With insights, graphs, projections."

**Q: Features for this age?**

> "Budget planning. 'If you keep spending like this, you'll run out by day 20.' Predictions. Consequences made visible before they happen."
