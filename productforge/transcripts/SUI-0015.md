## Part 2: Problem Exploration

**Q: As a single parent, what challenges do you face with financial education?**

> "I'm the only one. There's no backup. If I'm tired after work, the lesson doesn't happen. And I'm tired a lot. Burak sees me stressed about bills sometimes. I worry that's teaching him money is anxiety, not opportunity."

**Q: What do you wish for him?**

> "A healthier relationship with money than I have. I want him to see it as a tool, not a stressor. To plan, save, feel in control. Things I'm still learning myself."

## Part 4: Solution Reaction

**Q: What features would help your situation?**

> "Automation. Set it up once, it runs. Daily tasks repeating. Automatic allowance. I don't have bandwidth for manual tracking every day."

**Q: Pricing sensitivity?**

> "Very sensitive. Free or low-cost is essential. But if it's genuinely helpful and makes my life easier, I'd stretch for 30-40 TL."

**Q: What would make you recommend it?**

> "If Burak learned something meaningful that I couldn't teach him myself. If his relationship with money improved."
