## Part 2: Problem Exploration

**Q: What's your reaction to kids' finance apps in general?**

> "Skeptical. Another app? Kerem already has too much screen time. I'd rather teach him with real money, real experiences. Apps feel like a shortcut that doesn't actually work."

**Q: What concerns you specifically?**

> "Data collection. What are they doing with my child's information? And the gamification—is he learning, or is he just chasing dopamine hits? I've read about how these apps are designed to be addictive."

## Part 4: Solution Reaction

**Q: What would change your mind?**

> "Proof. Real testimonials from parents who saw behavior change. Studies. Endorsements from educators, not influencers. Show me it's educational, not entertainment dressed up."

**Q: What features would address your concerns?**

> "Clear data policy—I want to see exactly what's collected, stored, deleted. Usage limits—maybe the app itself limits screen time. And a mode where the child has to put down the phone and do the actual chore, not just tap a button."

**Q: Pricing?**

> "If it's genuinely educational and privacy-respecting, I'd pay premium. 100+ TL. But it has to earn that trust first. A strong free trial with clear evidence would be the entry point."
