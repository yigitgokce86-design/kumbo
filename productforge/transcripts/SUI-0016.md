## Child's Voice (Parent as Proxy)

**Q: What does Berk understand about money?**

> "He knows money buys things. But amounts? Not really. He once offered me 5 TL for a 300 TL toy. He thought that was generous!"

**Q: What would Berk want in an app?**

> "Based on what he likes in other apps: colorful animations, sound effects, characters. He loves when apps have a mascot—like Duolingo's owl. He'd want a character that celebrates with him."

**Q: Does Berk respond to progress bars?**

> "Oh yes. In his reading app, there's a tree that grows as he reads. He'll say 'Mom, look, my tree is SO big now!' He checks it constantly. Visual growth is powerful for him."

**Q: What would make him actually complete chores?**

> "If completing the chore was FUN in the app. Not just a checkbox. Maybe taking a photo of the clean room, the app recognizes it, makes confetti. Make the completion moment exciting."
