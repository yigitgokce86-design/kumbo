## Part 2: Problem Exploration

**Q: As a teacher, you see many children. How does Yağız compare?**

> "He's fairly typical. Most kids his age don't understand money. At school, we don't teach it—it's not in the curriculum. Parents expect schools to teach it, schools expect parents. Nobody's doing it systematically."

**Q: How have you addressed it at home?**

> "We talk about it. 'This costs more than that.' 'We need to save for vacation.' But it's abstract. He nods, but does he internalize? I'm not sure."

## Part 4: Solution Reaction

**Q: What would ideal financial education look like?**

> "Scaffolded. Like how we teach reading—start simple, build up. Start with 'what is saving?' Move to 'setting a goal.' Then 'earning through tasks.' Unlock complexity as they grow."

**Q: Gamification views?**

> "Useful, but not excessive. I see kids at school addicted to games that are pure sugar—all rewards, no learning. Balance is key. Reward progress, but make sure learning is happening."
