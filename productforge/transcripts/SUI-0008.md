## Part 2: Problem Exploration

**Q: How do you teach Yusuf about money?**

> "Old school. I give him cash, he puts it somewhere. When he wants something, I tell him to use his money. If he doesn't have enough, he waits. Simple. But maybe too simple—he doesn't really understand the system, just the outcome."

**Q: What's been difficult?**

> "He doesn't appreciate money. Once, he lost 50 TL and barely cared. 'It's just money,' he said. That bothered me a lot. He didn't work for it."

## Part 3: Behavior Deep-Dive

**Q: Have you connected his earning to work?**

> "Not really. I don't like the idea of paying for chores—it's his home, he should help. But maybe I need to reconsider. If he earned it, maybe he'd care more when he loses it."

## Part 4: Solution Reaction

**Q: Would you consider trying an app to help?**

> "I'm not a technology person. My wife uses apps more. If she set it up and showed me how to approve things, maybe. But I wouldn't figure it out alone."

**Q: What feature would convince you?**

> "If he learned to care about money. To feel the weight of earning it. That's what I want him to learn."
