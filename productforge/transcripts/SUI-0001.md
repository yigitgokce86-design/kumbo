## Part 1: Context & Background

**Q: Tell me about your family and your approach to teaching Defne about money.**

> "Defne is our only child. Both my husband and I work in tech—he's a software engineer, I'm a product manager. We're very intentional about everything with Defne, including money. We've tried to introduce concepts early, but honestly, it's harder than I expected. She's smart, but money is... abstract for her."

**Q: What apps or tools does Defne use regularly?**

> "She loves her tablet. Mostly educational games—Khan Academy Kids, some puzzle games. She watches YouTube Kids sometimes. She's very comfortable with technology."

## Part 2: Problem Exploration

**Q: How do you currently handle allowance or pocket money?**

> "We give her 20 TL every week. We tried a chart system where she gets stars for good behavior, and stars convert to money at the end of the month, but... it fell apart. We'd forget to give stars, she'd forget to ask, and suddenly two weeks passed. Now we just give the 20 TL on Sundays."

**Q: What methods have you tried to teach her about saving?**

> "She has a piggy bank—a cute elephant one. She puts coins in there. But here's the thing: she has no idea how much is in there. Neither do I, actually. Sometimes she shakes it and says 'I think I have a lot!' but it's completely opaque. There's no learning happening."

**Q: What's been most frustrating about teaching financial concepts?**

> "The disconnect between effort and reward. I want her to understand that money comes from work, but she sees us tap cards and money just... appears. When I try to explain 'mommy works to earn money,' she nods but I can tell she doesn't really get it. It's invisible to her."

**Q: Can you tell me about a time Defne wanted something expensive?**

> "Oh, constantly. Last month it was a LOL Surprise house—450 TL! She saw it on YouTube and wanted it immediately. I said we'd need to save for it, but she didn't understand what 'saving for it' actually meant. She asked every day, 'Do we have enough now?' It was exhausting. We ended up buying it for her birthday to end the torture."

## Part 3: Behavior Deep-Dive

**Q: Does Defne have savings goals? How does she track progress?**

> "Not really. The piggy bank is there, but there's no goal attached. She doesn't say 'I'm saving for X.' It's more like 'Mommy, I'm putting money in my elephant!' with no destination. I tried once to say 'Let's count when you have 100 TL,' but we never counted. It's on me too—I'm busy."

**Q: How do you connect chores to rewards?**

> "We've tried! Cleaning her room = 5 TL. Setting the table = 2 TL. But tracking it is a nightmare. I'd have to remember what she did, have small bills ready... it just doesn't work in practice. So now chores are just expected, and allowance is separate. Which defeats the purpose."

**Q: How does Defne react when she has to wait for something?**

> "Badly. [laughs] She's seven. Waiting is not her strength. But I think if she could SEE progress—like a visual thing—it might help. She loves progress bars in her games. When she sees '80% complete,' she's motivated. But with money, there's no progress bar."

## Part 4: Solution Reaction

**Q: If there was an app where Defne could set a goal like that LOL house and earn toward it through chores, how would you react?**

> "I would download it immediately. Seriously. That's exactly what we need. The key is SHE needs to see it—not just me tracking in my head. If she could see 'I'm at 50 TL out of 200 TL for my LOL house,' and it updates when she does chores? That's gamification that actually teaches something."

**Q: What features would be most important?**

> "Visual progress—like really visual, colorful, exciting for a 7-year-old. Notifications for me when she completes something. Maybe some celebration when she reaches a goal. And it needs to be EASY. If I have to do a lot of setup, I won't stick with it."

**Q: What would concern you about a financial app for your child?**

> "Privacy is huge. I work in tech, I know what companies do with data. If there are any ads, forget it. If it tracks her in weird ways, forget it. Also—no links to outside websites. She's seven. The app needs to be a safe, closed environment."

**Q: How much would you pay for something like this?**

> "If it works? 50-100 TL per month easily. Probably more. We spend more on random things that don't teach anything. Education that actually sticks is worth a lot."

## Part 5: Wrap-Up

**Q: What would the ideal money-learning experience look like?**

> "Defne opens the app, sees her goal—maybe a picture of the toy she wants. She sees a progress bar. She goes to do a chore on the list, marks it done, and the bar moves. She feels accomplished. At the end of the journey, there's a big celebration, and we go buy the thing together. That feeling of 'I earned this' is priceless."

**Q: What would stop you from trying a new app?**

> "Complicated setup, or if it feels sketchy—bad design, poor privacy policy. Also if Defne can't understand it herself. It needs to be for her, not for me."
