## Child's Voice (Parent as Proxy)

**Q: How does Arda think about earning?**

> "He's naturally entrepreneurial. He once tried to sell his drawings to neighbors! He understands 'work = money' better than most 10-year-olds. He just needs a system to channel that."

**Q: What frustrates him about the current situation?**

> "He complains there aren't enough ways to earn at home. 'I did all the chores, now what?' He wants more opportunities. More tasks, bigger rewards for harder tasks."

**Q: What about delayed gratification?**

> "He's okay with waiting IF he can see progress. 'Two more weeks' doesn't mean much. But 'You're 70% there!' is tangible. He's very visual and mathematical."
