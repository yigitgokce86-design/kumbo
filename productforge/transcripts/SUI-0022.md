## Part 2: Problem Exploration

**Q: With three kids across a wide age range, what's your biggest challenge?**

> "Consistency. I can't remember who did what, who's owed what. My wife and I disagree sometimes on what we promised. It's chaos. We need a single source of truth."

**Q: How do they each understand money differently?**

> "Zehra has no clue—she's 6. Yavuz is starting to get it. Selim thinks he knows everything but still blows his money on junk. Three different levels, three different approaches needed."

## Part 4: Solution Reaction

**Q: What features would help with three kids?**

> "A family dashboard where I see all three at a glance. Who's close to their goal, who hasn't done tasks this week. Let me manage centrally, but let each kid have their own experience."

**Q: Anything else?**

> "Maybe let the older one 'mentor' the younger? Selim could help Zehra understand saving. That would teach HIM responsibility too."
