## Part 2: Problem Exploration

**Q: How structured is your approach to Ada's financial education?**

> "Honestly, not very. My business takes so much time. I know I should be more intentional, but I keep putting it off. Every few months I think 'I should set up a system' and then I don't."

**Q: What's stopped you from starting?**

> "It feels like a project. And I have enough projects. I need something ready-made that I can just plug in and it works without me having to design the whole system."

## Part 4: Solution Reaction

**Q: What would get you to actually use something?**

> "If someone sent me a link, I signed up in 30 seconds, and it just worked with defaults. 'Here's a standard allowance schedule, here are common chores, here's a sample goal.' Done. I can customize later if I want."

**Q: Market positioning thoughts?**

> "Don't call it a banking app or a game. Call it 'money education' or 'financial literacy.' Parents like me want educational credibility. We'll pay for 'this teaches my kid' more than 'this is fun.'"
