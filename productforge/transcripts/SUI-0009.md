## Part 2: Problem Exploration

**Q: How does Zeynep understand money right now?**

> "She doesn't. And that's okay at 6, but I want to start building the foundation. When I pay at the store, she asks 'Is that a lot?' and I never know how to answer."

**Q: What visual methods have you tried?**

> "We do a sticker chart for behavior, not money. But she LOVES it. Every sticker is a celebration. If there was something like that for saving, she'd be all over it."

## Part 4: Solution Reaction

**Q: What would the ideal app look like for Zeynep?**

> "Colorful. Really colorful. With sounds—little dings when something happens. Animations when she hits a goal. Stickers she can collect. Make it feel like a reward just to use it."

**Q: Educational content?**

> "For her age, not really lessons. More like... story-based learning? A character who saves up for something, and she follows along. She learns through narratives."
