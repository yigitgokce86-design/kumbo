## Part 2: Problem Exploration

**Q: Deniz is older—does he understand money better?**

> "Somewhat. He knows things cost money, he knows we work to earn it. But delayed gratification? That's still a struggle. He wants the new PlayStation game NOW. Saving for a month feels like eternity to him."

**Q: How have you tried to address this?**

> "We've done 'matching'—if he saves 200 TL, we'll add 100 TL. That motivated him a bit. But tracking his savings is on him, and he's not great at it. He keeps money in a drawer, loses track, and then says 'I think I have about 150?' Very approximate."

**Q: What methods haven't worked?**

> "Lecturing. [laughs] I tried explaining compound interest, budgeting, the value of patience... but at 12, his eyes glaze over. He needs to EXPERIENCE it, not hear about it."

## Part 3: Behavior Deep-Dive

**Q: Tell me about a time he had to wait for something.**

> "His gaming headset. He wanted a 400 TL one. We said he'd have to pay half. It took him six weeks of saving birthday money, odd jobs, selling some old games. When he finally got it, he treated it like gold. Much more carefully than things we just buy him."

**Q: Did that experience change his behavior?**

> "For that specific item, yes. He values it. But it didn't generalize. The next thing he wanted, we were back to 'Can I have it NOW?' I think we need more repetitions of that experience."

## Part 4: Solution Reaction

**Q: What would help create more of those experiences?**

> "Something that makes the saving journey visible and shorter. Weekly milestones maybe. And some way to show him the 'earned reward' is different from 'given reward.' When he earns it, he cares more. How do you design for that?"

**Q: Feature priorities?**

> "For his age—maybe some financial lessons built in. Not baby stuff, but quick facts. 'Did you know if you save X per week, you'll reach Y in Z weeks?' Make the math visible."
