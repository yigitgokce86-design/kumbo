## Part 2: Problem Exploration

**Q: What pedagogical approaches do you use at home?**

> "I try to make everything experiential. For money, I've created little 'shops' where he can buy toys from me with play money. It works when I have time to set it up, which isn't often."

**Q: What's the challenge?**

> "Sustainability. I can do a great one-time activity, but daily reinforcement? That's where I fail. I need something that does the daily reinforcement for me."

## Part 4: Solution Reaction

**Q: What would daily reinforcement look like?**

> "A notification saying 'Mert, did you do your task today?' Not to me—to HIM. A gentle nudge that's part of his routine, like brushing teeth. And then a visible update—his progress bar moves."

**Q: Onboarding considerations?**

> "Let me try before I commit. Free trial, or a fully functional free tier. I'm willing to pay, but I need to see it work with MY kid first. Every child is different."
