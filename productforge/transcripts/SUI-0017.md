## Child's Voice (Parent as Proxy)

**Q: How does Dilan interact with the concept of money?**

> "She doesn't really yet. She knows the store is where toys come from. She doesn't understand we exchange something for them. It's magic to her—we just take things."

**Q: What would help her understand?**

> "Something visual. Maybe a jar filling up on screen? With actual pictures of the toys she can 'earn.' She responds to pictures more than words or numbers."

**Q: What games does she enjoy?**

> "Simple ones. Toca Boca games—no text, just interaction. She taps things, things happen. If saving could be like that..."

**Q: What would her ideal experience be?**

> "She sees a picture of a doll she wants. She taps 'I want this!' Every day, she does a task. She taps 'done!' A coin or star flies to the doll picture. When enough coins are there, the doll sparkles. She gets it."
