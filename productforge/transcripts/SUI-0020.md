## Child's Voice (Parent as Proxy)

**Q: What does Emir enjoy in apps currently?**

> "He plays a lot of simulation games. Running a zoo, building a city. He likes 'managing' things. If saving could feel like managing his own little economy, he'd be into it."

**Q: How does he react to visual progress?**

> "Loves it. In his zoo game, he checks every day how many coins he's earned. He does the math! 'I have 523 coins, the elephant is 600, I need 77 more.' He's never done that kind of math for homework."

**Q: Would gamification work for him?**

> "100%. The more game-like, the better. But it has to feel fair—clear rules, predictable rewards. If he does X, he gets Y. No confusion."
