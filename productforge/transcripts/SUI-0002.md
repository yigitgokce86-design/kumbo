## Part 1: Context & Background

**Q: Tell me about your family setup.**

> "I'm a finance director, my wife is a doctor. Can is 10, very independent for his age. He's into gaming—Minecraft, Roblox, that kind of thing. We've tried to teach him about money since we both deal with it professionally, but it's different with kids."

## Part 2: Problem Exploration

**Q: How do you handle allowance?**

> "30 TL weekly, plus he can earn extra for specific tasks. We have a whiteboard in the kitchen where I write tasks and values. Mowing the small garden patch is 20 TL. Helping with groceries is 10 TL. The system works... sort of."

**Q: What's the challenge?**

> "The whiteboard gets messy. Tasks pile up, some get done, some don't, and then I have to track who owes what. It's like running a small payroll for one kid. [laughs] Also, the connection isn't immediate. He does the task Tuesday, I pay Sunday. By Sunday, he's forgotten what he earned it for."

**Q: Has Can ever saved for something himself?**

> "Yes, actually. He saved 350 TL for a Minecraft LEGO set over about two months. But honestly, I had to manage that for him. I kept a note on my phone of his balance. He'd ask 'How much do I have?' and I'd check my notes. Not ideal."

## Part 3: Behavior Deep-Dive

**Q: Did seeing progress toward the LEGO set motivate him?**

> "Absolutely. Every few days he'd ask 'How close am I?' And when I said 'You're at 300, only 50 to go!' he got really excited. That last stretch was the most motivated I've ever seen him about chores. He asked for extra tasks. Imagine if that was automatic."

**Q: How would you improve the current system?**

> "Something where HE can see his balance, not just ask me. And where when he completes a task, it immediately updates. That immediacy matters. Kids don't think in weekly cycles. They think in right-now."

---

## Part 4: Solution Reaction

**Q: Describe your ideal solution.**

> "An app where I can set up tasks once—not every week. Repeating tasks. He opens his app, sees what's available, does the task, I get a notification to approve, and boom—his balance updates. Goal tracking built in. Maybe even a leaderboard if we have a second kid someday."

**Q: What about for the child's experience?**

> "It needs to feel like a game. He plays Roblox where you earn virtual currency; this should feel similar but for real rewards. Achievements, levels, something that hooks him. Otherwise he'll lose interest."

**Q: Concerns?**

> "Screen time is already a battle. I don't want another app that makes it worse. It should be quick—open, check, close. Not designed to keep him scrolling."

---

## Part 5: Wrap-Up

**Q: Most important feature?**

> "Instant feedback when a task is done. That loop of action → reward needs to be tight."
