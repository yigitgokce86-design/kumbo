## Part 2: Problem Exploration

**Q: How do you manage money education with two children of different ages?**

> "It's complicated! What works for Cem at 10 is too advanced for Ela at 7. And they compare constantly. 'Why does he get more allowance?' 'She always finishes her goals faster!' Everything becomes a sibling competition."

**Q: Is that competition helpful or harmful?**

> "Both. Competition motivates them, but it can also lead to resentment. I need a way to keep things individual yet visible. Maybe they can see each other's progress, but goals are personalized?"

## Part 4: Solution Reaction

**Q: What would multi-child support need to include?**

> "Separate profiles, obviously. Different age-appropriate experiences. But also—and this is key—fair parenting tools. If I give Cem a 50 TL task, it should suggest an equivalent for Ela's level. Help me be fair."

**Q: Would you pay more for multi-child features?**

> "If it's one family price for both kids, yes. If I have to pay per child monthly, it feels punitive for having two kids."
