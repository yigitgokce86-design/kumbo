## Part 2: Problem Exploration

**Q: As a stay-at-home parent, how do you approach teaching Ali about money?**

> "I have more time to focus on it, which is good. But honestly, I don't know the best approach. I didn't learn about money as a kid—we just didn't have much to manage. I don't want to pass that on."

**Q: What have you tried?**

> "We use cash mostly. Every week, I give him 15 TL in coins. He puts it in a jar. But it's not really teaching anything, it's just... accumulating. I want him to understand WHY we save, not just that we do."

**Q: What's missing?**

> "A connection to real life. When we go to the store and I say 'This is 50 TL,' he doesn't connect that to his jar. They're separate worlds in his mind."

## Part 3: Behavior Deep-Dive

**Q: Has Ali ever wanted something and had to save for it?**

> "Yes, he wanted a remote control car. I told him to save. After two months, he had enough, but by then he wanted something else! So the money just sat there. There was no urgency, no progress tracking."

**Q: How did that make you feel?**

> "Frustrated. Like I'd failed at the one lesson I was trying to teach. The goal drifted, and so did the motivation."

## Part 4: Solution Reaction

**Q: What would have helped?**

> "A picture of the car, somewhere he could see every day. And a number that goes up each week. So he can see 'I'm THIS close' and stay excited."

**Q: Would you use an app for this?**

> "If it's not too complicated. I'm okay with phones, but I'm not great with new apps. If you showed me how it works in 2 minutes, I'd try it."
