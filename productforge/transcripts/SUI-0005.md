## Part 2: Problem Exploration

**Q: How's the chore-reward dynamic in your house?**

> "It's a constant negotiation. 'I'll clean my room for 10 TL.' 'No, that's expected.' 'What about washing the car with Dad?' 'Okay, that's extra.' We don't have a clear system, and Efe knows how to exploit that. He's a born negotiator."

**Q: Has this affected his understanding of work and money?**

> "Actually, I think it has—just not in the direction I wanted. He thinks everything is negotiable. He doesn't understand some things you just do without payment. We've muddied the waters."

## Part 3: Behavior Deep-Dive

**Q: What games does Efe play?**

> "He's obsessed with Brawl Stars. He understands that game's economy better than our household economy! He saves gems, only spends on deals, knows the value of each character. If only we could tap into that for real money."

**Q: What makes those game economies engaging?**

> "Visual progress. Daily rewards. Surprise boxes. The dopamine hits. It's designed perfectly to keep him coming back. An app for saving would need some of that magic."

## Part 4: Solution Reaction

**Q: What gamification elements would work?**

> "Daily check-ins with a small reward—maybe a streak bonus. Badges for completing goals. Maybe levels—'Saver Level 1, Level 2.' Something he can show off to his cousins. Status matters at 8."

**Q: What wouldn't work?**

> "Anything that feels like homework. If it sends notifications that feel like nags, he'll tune it out. It needs to feel like his choice, his game."
