## Part 2: Problem Exploration

**Q: Tell me about your approach to money with Elif.**

> "We're careful with money, so Elif sees that. She knows things cost money. But we don't do allowance—there's nothing extra to give. What she gets, she gets from grandparents at holidays."

**Q: What concerns you about the future?**

> "That she'll grow up without money skills. Rich kids get these lessons; poorer kids don't. I want her to have the same opportunities to learn."

## Part 4: Solution Reaction

**Q: How would you react to a financial learning app?**

> "I'd love it—IF it's free or very cheap. 50 TL a month is a lot for us. But if it's 10-15 TL, or has a free version, I'd definitely try."

**Q: What features matter most?**

> "The educational part more than the money tracking. We don't have much to track. But teaching her about saving, waiting, making choices—that's valuable even without real money."

**Q: What would onboarding need to consider?**

> "That not everyone has weekly allowance to enter. Maybe you can set virtual points instead of TL? So it's about the lesson, not the actual amount."
