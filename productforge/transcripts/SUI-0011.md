## Part 2: Problem Exploration

**Q: As an entrepreneur, how do you approach teaching business and money?**

> "I try to give Toprak an 'entrepreneurial' mindset. We've done lemonade stands, sold his old toys. He gets it when there's a direct transaction. But day-to-day, he still doesn't connect allowance to any effort. It's just... money that appears."

**Q: What systems have you tried?**

> "We created a 'family bank.' I printed fake money, he deposits it with me, I give 'interest.' Fun experiment, but managing it is a pain. And it's paper—loses track quickly."

## Part 4: Solution Reaction

**Q: What would you want from an app?**

> "Digitize my family bank. Let him see his balance, accruing interest. Let me set up tasks, pay bounties. Maybe even simulate business—'You created lemonade. How much would you charge?'"

**Q: Onboarding expectations?**

> "I want power features but fast setup. Don't dumb it down too much. I can handle complexity if it gives me flexibility. But I need to see value in first 5 minutes."

**Q: What would you pay?**

> "200 TL a month if it does what I'm describing. This is an investment in my kid's future."
