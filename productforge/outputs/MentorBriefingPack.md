# Kumbo - Mentor Briefing Pack v1.0

## North Star Vision
Empower the next generation with financial literacy by making saving tangible, rewarding, and fun—through a parent-guided, goal-based experience.

## Core Mission
Transform abstract money concepts into concrete, achievable experiences for children aged 6-14 while giving parents visibility and control over their child's financial education journey.

## Value Hypothesis
If we help children set specific product goals and earn towards them through chores and tasks, they will develop delayed gratification skills and understand the value of money better than through traditional allowance methods.

## Dual-User Design Philosophy
1. **Child Experience**: Gamified, visual, low-text, rewarding
2. **Parent Dashboard**: Control, visibility, educational tracking, reward management

## Core Habit Loop
```
EARN → SAVE → ACHIEVE → CELEBRATE
```
- **Earn**: Complete chores/tasks assigned by parents
- **Save**: Watch progress bars fill toward goals
- **Achieve**: Reach goal and "unlock" the reward
- **Celebrate**: Milestone celebrations and learning reinforcement

## Strategic Differentiators
1. **Education First**: Financial literacy lessons embedded in the experience
2. **Parent Partnership**: Not just kid-facing; parents are co-pilots
3. **Tangible Goals**: Real products/experiences, not abstract numbers
4. **Privacy Obsession**: Child data protection as a feature, not afterthought

## Target Market Entry
- **Beachhead**: Turkish families with children 6-14
- **Expansion Path**: Turkey → MENA → Europe → Global

## Success Definition (12 months)
- 10,000+ active families
- 70%+ goal completion rate
- NPS > 50 from both parents and children
