## Rationale & Benchmarks
- **Competitor Analysis**:
    - *Greenlight (US)*: ~$5.99/mo (Purchasing power adjust: ~180 TL -> too expensive).
    - *GoHenry (UK)*: ~£3.99/mo (Purchasing power adjust: ~160 TL -> too expensive).
    - *Netflix Turkey*: Basic plan ~120 TL/mo.
    - *Spotify Turkey*: Individual ~60 TL/mo.
- **Willingness to Pay (SUI Data)**:
    - SUI-0001: "50-100 TL per month easily."
    - SUI-0015: "Very sensitive... maybe 30-40 TL."
    - SUI-0023: "Premium if proven... 100+ TL."
- **Decision**: **49.99 TL** is the sweet spot—under the psychological "50 TL" barrier, comparable to a coffee, accessible to middle class, but high enough to support development.

## Unit Economics (Estimated)
- **LTV (Lifetime Value)**:
    - Monthly Churn Estimate: 5%
    - Avg User Lifetime: 20 months
    - LTV = 50 TL * 20 = **1,000 TL**
- **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)**:
    - Target Blended CAC: **150 - 200 TL**
    - LTV:CAC Ratio: **5:1** (Healthy)

## Psychology
- **"Less than a coffee a month"**: Framing for 49.99 TL.
- **"Investment in future"**: Framing for Lifetime plan.
- **"Peace of mind"**: Transformation promise.
