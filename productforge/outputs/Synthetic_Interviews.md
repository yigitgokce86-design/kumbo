# Synthetic User Interviews: Key Findings (Summary of 25 Simulations)

## 1. The "Invisible Money" Problem is Real (Validates H1)
*   **Parent Quote:** "My son thinks the credit card is a magic wand. He doesn't understand that money runs out."
*   **Insight:** Parents are desperate for a way to visualize *limits*. They don't just want a savings app; they want a "No, we can't buy that" app.

## 2. Gamification > Numbers (Validates H2)
*   **Child (Gamer) Quote:** "I don't care about having 100 Lira. But if I need 100 Lira to unlock the 'Skate Park' level or buy my skin, I will save."
*   **Insight:** Currency itself is boring. The *goal* is the hook. The progress bar must look like a game HP bar.
*   **Surprise:** Kids cared more about "Badges" and "Streaks" (duolingo style) than interest rates.

## 3. High Friction on ID Verification (Validates H6)
*   **Parent Quote:** "I'm not giving my kid's ID to a random startup app just to track chores. I'll use a spreadsheet instead."
*   **Insight:** The MVP MUST work without KYC (Know Your Customer) / Identity Verification. It should be a "Simulated Wallet" first. Real banking features can come later as a premium trust upgrade.

## 4. Willingness to Pay is Mixed (Partial Support H3)
*   **The Busy Enabler:** Willing to pay ~50-100 TL/mo if it automates allowance.
*   **The Traditionalist:** Expects it to be free. "Why pay to save money?"
*   **Pivot:** Freemium model is essential. Free for tracking, Paid for "Education Content" / "Premium Avatars" / "Multiple Kids".

## 5. The "Cash" Gap
*   **Problem:** Kids still get cash from grandparents. Use cases show parents need a "Manual Add" button to log cash gifts into the digital balance.
*   **Feature Request:** "Hybrid Wallet" feature is a must-have. (Track cash + digital together).

## 6. Chores vs. Allowance (Validates H4)
*   **Insight:** Parents prefer "Task-based Earning" over "Universal Basic Income" (flat allowance). They want kids to *earn* the money.
*   **Action:** The "Task Approval" flow is critical.

## Validated Features for MVP
1.  **Hybrid Wallet:** Track manual cash + digital allowance.
2.  **Visual Goal:** Upload photo of the target.
3.  **Task-Based Earning:** Parent approves -> Kid gets money.
4.  **No-KYC Onboarding:** Totally anonymous start.
