# Go-to-Market (GTM) Strategy: Kumbo

## 1. Launch Strategy (Phase 1: Alpha/Beta)

### Target Audience
*   **The "Conscious Tech Parent":** Early adopters, likely working in tech/corporate, already looking for solutions.

### Channels
*   **A. Community Infiltration:**
    *   LinkedIn (Founder-led storytelling: "Why I built this for my kid").
    *   Facebook Groups (Mom/Dad groups in Istanbul/Ankara/Izmir).
    *   Twitter/X (Fintech circles).
*   **B. Waitlist Viral Loop:**
    *   "Get early access + Lifetime Badge for your kid."
    *   "Invite 3 parent friends to unlock the 'Space Suit' avatar."

### Goal
*   100 Beta Families.
*   collect qualitative feedback.

## 2. Growth Strategy (Phase 2: Public Launch)

### Acquisition Channels
*   **Influencer Marketing (Primary):**
    *   Micro-influencers (Moms/Dads with 10k-50k followers) who focus on *parenting advice* or *montessori*, not just lifestyle.
    *   Content: "How I stopped the toy store meltdown."
*   **SEO / Content Marketing:**
    *   Blog: "Financial Literacy for Kids 101", "Allowance Guide for different ages".
    *   Tools: Free "Allowance Calculator" (Web tool).
*   **School Partnerships (Long-term):**
    *   Pilot programs with private schools (K-12) as a "Financial Literacy Aid".

## 3. Retention Strategy
*   **The "Friday Notification":** Reminder to parents to review tasks/pay allowance.
*   **Weekly Report:** Email summary of "What your child learned this week" (Reinforces value to parent).
*   **Streaks:** For kids (Daily log-in, Weekly saving).

## 4. Risks & Mitigations
*   **Risk:** Parents download but forget to use.
    *   *Mitigation:* SMS/WhatsApp notifications (higher open rate than push).
*   **Risk:** Kids get bored.
    *   *Mitigation:* Physical "Starter Kit" (Stickers/Card) in Premium tier to bridge digital-physical gap.
