# Investor Q&A Playbook

## Q1: "Why can't a bank just build this?"
**A:** Banks focus on *transactions* (Interchange fees). Their UX is designed for adults. We focus on *education and behavior change*. Our "North Star" metric is "Financial Literacy," not "Transaction Volume." Also, banks struggle to build "fun" products suitable for 7-year-olds.

## Q2: "How do you make money if you don't charge transaction fees?"
**A:** We are a SaaS (Software as a Service) for parenting. Parents are willing to pay for *education* (like Duolingo or private tutors). We charge for the "Learning Value," not the "Money Movement."

## Q3: "What stops a generic To-Do list app from killing you?"
**A:** Context. A generic To-Do list doesn't have a "Wallet," doesn't visualize "Savings Goals," and doesn't have the specific "Parent Approval" logic tied to a balance. We integrate the *workflow* of allowance.

## Q4: "How do you handle KYC constraints?"
**A:** We don't. We act as a "Simulated Ledger" initially. This allows us to onboard users instantly without asking for ID cards. This lowers our CAC and friction significantly compared to neobanks.

## Q5: "What is your viral loop?"
**A:** "Inviting the external family." Grandparents want to give money for birthdays. We give them a way to contribute to the child's "Digital Goal" via a link, pulling them into the ecosystem.
