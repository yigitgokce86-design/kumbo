*   **Pain Points:**
    *   "Money is invisible" (credit cards/digital payments make it abstract).
    *   Impatience (wants things *now*).
    *   Lack of agency (has to ask permission for every purchase).

### Secondary ICP: The "Conscious Guide" Parent
*   **Demographics:** Millennial/Gen X parents (30-50), urban/suburban, middle to upper-middle income.
*   **Psychographics:** Values financial literacy, worried about consumerism/spoiling, tech-savvy but safety-conscious.
*   **Behaviors:** Uses mobile banking, tracks household expenses, manages allowance manually (cash or varied digital transfers).
*   **Pain Points:**
    *   Tired of "I want this" arguments in stores.
    *   Inconsistent allowance tracking.
    *   Struggle to explain value of money/saving concepts simply.

## 2. Jobs to be Done (JTBD)

### Parent Jobs
*   **Main Job:** "Teach my child the value of money and patience so they become responsible adults."
*   **Functional Job:** "Give allowance and track chores without carrying cash or forgetting."
*   **Emotional Job:** "Feel like a 'good parent' who is equipping their child with essential life skills."
*   **Social Job:** "Show other parents/family that we are raising grounded, smart kids."

### Child Jobs
*   **Main Job:** "Get the things I want (toys, skins, treats) by myself."
*   **Functional Job:** "See how much money I have and how close I am to my target."
*   **Emotional Job:** "Feel grown-up, independent, and proud of earning/saving."
*   **Social Job:** "Show my friends/parents what I saved up for."

## 3. Value Proposition Alignment
*   **For Kids:** Gamifies the boring waiting part of saving; turns chores into clear progress toward a reward.
*   **For Parents:** Automates the "teaching" part; provides a conflict-free framework for "No, you can't afford that yet" conversations.
