# Market Landscape: Financial Literacy for Kids (Turkey & Global)

## 1. Market Sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM)

### Global Context
*   **TAM (Total Addressable Market):** Global financial literacy market expected to reach **$4B+ by 2030**.
*   **Driver:** Shift from cash to digital payments (cashless society) making money "invisible" to kids.

### Turkey Context (TR)
*   **TAM (Total Addressable Market):** ~19 Million children under 18 in Turkey.
*   **SAM (Serviceable Available Market):** ~10 Million children (Age 6-14) in urban/suburban households with internet access.
*   **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):** ~500k - 1M active users in 3 years (Considering competitor penetration like Papara/Manibux).

## 2. Key Trends

### A. The "Cashless" Dilemma
*   **Trend:** Physical piggy banks are obsolete. Kids don't see money transfer.
*   **Impact:** Parents struggle to teach "spending limits" when money is just a tap on a screen.
*   **Opportunity:** Apps that visualize "digital money" concretely (like health bars in games).

### B. Gamification of Finance
*   **Trend:** Education apps (Duolingo) set the standard. Kids expect badges, streaks, and characters.
*   **Impact:** Boring banking apps fail to retain kids <12.
*   **Opportunity:** Kumbo's "Character/Guide" approach fits perfectly here.

### C. Hyper-Inflation Reality (Turkey Specific)
*   **Trend:** High inflation makes "saving for a year" discoureging. value melts.
*   **Impact:** Teaching "investment" or "gold/dollar" saving might be more relevant than simple Lira saving.
*   **Opportunity:** Features that might explain "Purchasing Power" simply (advanced feature).

## 3. Customer Segments & Willingness to Pay

*   **Segment A (Analogs):** Use cash/piggy bank. Low willingness to pay.
*   **Segment B (Digital Bank Parents):** Use Garanti/IsBank/YapiKredi apps. Want integration. Moderate willingness to pay.
*   **Segment C (Fintech Natives):** Use Papara/Manibux. High digital adoption, but accustomed to "Free" products.
    *   *Challenge:* Competing with "Free" cards.
    *   *Strategy:* Competing on "Education/Content" (SaaS) rather than just "Transaction" (Interchange fee).
