# Kumbo - Financial Assumptions

## 1. Growth & Acquisition
- **Conversion Rate**: Starts at 10% (conservative for freemium utility) growing to 30% as product matures and network effects kick in.
- **CAC**: Assumed low (20-30 TL) initially due to organic growth, social sharing/viral loops ("Invite a parent"), and low-cost digital channels in Turkey.
- **Active Users**: MAU is ~50% of total downloads (high retention expected for utility app).

## 2. Revenue
- **Blended ARPU**: Weighted average of Free (0 TL), Monthly (50 TL), Annual (500 TL), and Lifetime users.
- **Pricing Stability**: Assumed no price increase for 3 years (volume strategy first).
- **In-App Purchases**: Cosmetic only, ~5% of revenue (conservative).

## 3. Costs
- **Payment Processing**: 3% of revenue (Iyzico/PayTR standard).
- **Server Costs**: 0.50 TL per active user/month (Firebase optimization).
- **Salaries**:
    - Y1: Founder + 1 Dev (Lean).
    - Y3: Full product team.
    - Y5: Expanded corp structure.

## 4. Market Context (from EvidenceLedger)
- **Market Size**: Turkey has ~23M children (0-17). Target is 6-14 (~11M).
- **Y5 Capture**: 1.5M downloads represents ~13% market penetration (Audacious but possible given mobile banking adoption stats).
- **Inflation**: Model assumes "Real TL" (2025 basis); pricing would likely adjust with inflation irl.

## 5. Risks & Sensitivities
- **Risk**: Conversion rate stays <5%. -> **Impact**: Revenue drops significantly, break-even delayed to Y5.
- **Risk**: CAC spikes to >100 TL. -> **Impact**: Marketing budget burns out runway.
- **Risk**: Churn >10% monthly. -> **Impact**: LTV crashes, unit economics fail.
