# Synthetic User Interview (SUI25) Plan: Kumbo

## Methodology
We will simulate 25 interviews with distinct personas representing our ICPs to test our hypotheses.

## Personas (Total: 25)

### Segment A: Parents (15)
*   **5x "The Anxious Optimizer":** Highly educated, worried about kids' future, uses Excel/Apps.
*   **5x "The Traditionalist":** Cash-based, believes in physical piggy banks, skeptical of screen time.
*   **5x "The Busy Enabler":** High income, guilt-spends, gives in to tantrums, wants automation.

### Segment B: Children (10)
*   **4x "The Gamer":** (8-12) Familiar with game currencies (Robux), visually motivated.
*   **3x "The Saver":** (10-14) Naturally anxious/careful, likes seeing numbers go up.
*   **3x "The Spender":** (6-9) Impulsive, wants toys NOW, frustrated by waiting.

## Key Questions (Hypothesis Testing)
1.  **H1 (Invisible Money):** "How do you explain to your child that you are spending money when you just tap a card?"
2.  **H2 (Visual Goals):** "Would you save more if you had a picture of the LEGO set on your screen, or just the number 500 TL?"
3.  **H3 (Willingness to Pay):** "If an app stopped the 'I want this' arguments in the grocery store, how much would you pay for it monthly?"
4.  **H6 (Privacy):** "Would you put your child's TC Identity Number into a new app to get a physical card?"

## Output
*   **Transcripts:** Summarized key quotes and patterns.
*   **Insight Synthesis:** Validated/Invalidated hypotheses matrix.
